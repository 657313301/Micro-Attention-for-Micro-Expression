# Introduction
This repository contains the Micro Attention module described in the paper "Micro-Attention for Micro-Expression recognition" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02360). The Micro-Attention is outperform the method described in the paper "From Macro to Micro Expression Recognition: Deep Learning on Small Datasets Using Transfer Learning.", the latter is won the first place in the Facial Micro-Expression Grand Challenge (MEGC2018).
